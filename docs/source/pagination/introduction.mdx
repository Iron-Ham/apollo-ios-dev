Apollo Pagination provides a convenient and easy way to interact with and watch paginated APIs. It is designed to work with any GraphQL server, and it is the recommended way to handle pagination in Apollo Client.

Apollo Pagination provides two classes to interact with paginated data: [`GraphQLQueryPager`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/graphqlquerywatcher) and [`AsyncGraphQLQueryPager`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios/docc/documentation/apollo/graphqlquerywatcher).
